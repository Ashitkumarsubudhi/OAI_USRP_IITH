This is the repository that we have used to build the OAI-USRP setup:

For the False Base Station (FBS) work submitted in FNWF 2025, the files with their location we have modified in the 5g-ue-dev are:
1. **openairinterface5g-IITH/openair2/LAYER2/NR_MAC_UE/nr_ue_scheduler.c**
2. **openairinterface5g-IITH/openair2/LAYER2/NR_MAC_UE/nr_ra_procedures.c**
3. **openairinterface5g-IITH/openair2/LAYER2/NR_MAC_UE/mac_defs.h**
wherever we added code, we just added the comment IITH.
