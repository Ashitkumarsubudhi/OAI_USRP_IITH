This is the repository that we have used to build the OAI-USRP setup:
For the False Base Station (FBS) work, the files with their location we have modified in the 5g-ue-dev are **openairinterface5g-IITH/openair2/LAYER2/NR_MAC_UE/nr_ue_scheduler.c**, **openairinterface5g-IITH/openair2/LAYER2/NR_MAC_UE/nr_ra_procedures.c** and **openairinterface5g-IITH/openair2/LAYER2/NR_MAC_UE/mac_defs.h** 
Wherever we added code, we just added the comment IITH.
